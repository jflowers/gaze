# Taxonomy Reference

Canonical reference tables for the Gaze effect taxonomy, scoring formulas, and classification thresholds. This is the spec sheet — use it while implementing.

For explanations and rationale, see [contracts.md](contracts.md). For capability requirements, see [requirements.md](requirements.md).

## Scoring Formulas

| Formula | Definition | Variables |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| CRAP | `comp² × (1 - cov/100)³ + comp` | `comp` = cyclomatic complexity (int >= 1); `cov` = line coverage % (0–100) |
| GazeCRAP | `comp² × (1 - cc/100)³ + comp` | `comp` = cyclomatic complexity (int >= 1); `cc` = contract coverage % (0–100) |
| CRAPload | `count(functions where CRAP >= threshold)` | `threshold` default = 15 |
| GazeCRAPload | `count(functions where GazeCRAP >= threshold)` | `threshold` default = 15 |

### Reference Values

| Complexity | Line Coverage | CRAP |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| 1 | 100% | 1.0 |
| 1 | 0% | 2.0 |
| 1 | 50% | 1.125 |
| 5 | 100% | 5.0 |
| 5 | 50% | 8.125 |
| 5 | 0% | 30.0 |
| 10 | 100% | 10.0 |
| 10 | 50% | 22.5 |
| 10 | 0% | 110.0 |
| 15 | 100% | 15.0 |
| 15 | 0% | 240.0 |
| 20 | 100% | 20.0 |
| 20 | 50% | 70.0 |

## Classification Thresholds

| Label | Condition | Default |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Contractual | `score >= contractual_threshold` | 80 |
| Ambiguous | `incidental_threshold <= score < contractual_threshold` | [50, 80) |
| Incidental | `score < incidental_threshold` | 50 |

### Confidence Score Formula

```
score = clamp(base + tier_boost + sum(signal_weights) - contradiction_penalty, 0, 100)
```

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Base confidence | 50 |
| Tier boost (P0) | +25 |
| Tier boost (P1) | +10 |
| Tier boost (P2–P4) | 0 |
| Contradiction penalty | -20 (applied when both positive and negative signals exist) |

### Effective Starting Scores

| Tier | Starting Score | Distance to Contractual (80) |
|------|---------------|------------------------------|
| P0 | 75 | 5 points (one small positive signal reaches contractual) |
| P1 | 60 | 20 points (needs moderate positive evidence) |
| P2–P4 | 50 | 30 points (needs strong positive evidence) |

---

## Signal Weights

| Signal | Source ID | Max Positive | Max Negative | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Interface Satisfaction | `interface` | +30 | 0 | Method satisfies an interface/trait/protocol |
| API Visibility | `visibility` | +20 | 0 | Sum of: exported function (+8), exported return type (+6), exported receiver type (+6); clamped to 20 |
| Caller Dependency | `caller` | +15 | 0 | 1 caller = +5, 2–3 = +10, 4+ = +15 |
| Naming Convention | `naming` | +10 | -10 | Contractual prefixes vs. incidental prefixes |
| Naming (Sentinel) | `naming` | +30 | — | `Err*` sentinel errors only; exceeds normal max |
| Documentation (direct) | `godoc` | +15 | -15 | Keyword matches the detected effect type |
| Documentation (indirect) | `godoc_keyword_indirect` | +5 | — | Keyword found but effect type doesn't match |
| Contradiction | `contradiction` | — | -20 | Auto-applied when positive + negative signals coexist |

---

## Quadrant Classification

| Quadrant | ID | CRAP | GazeCRAP | Meaning |
|----------|----|------|----------|---------|
| Safe | Q1_Safe | < threshold | < threshold | Low risk, well tested |
| Complex But Tested | Q2_ComplexButTested | >= threshold | < threshold | Complex but contracts verified |
| Simple But Underspecified | Q3_SimpleButUnderspecified | < threshold | >= threshold | Simple but contracts not verified |
| Dangerous | Q4_Dangerous | >= threshold | >= threshold | Complex AND contracts not verified |

Default thresholds: CRAP = 15, GazeCRAP = 15 (independently configurable).

---

## Fix Strategies

Assigned to functions in the CRAPload (CRAP >= threshold). Evaluated in order; first matching rule wins.

| Priority | Strategy | Condition | Action |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | `add_tests` | Default (none of the below) | Add tests to increase coverage |
| 1 | `add_assertions` | Quadrant == Q3 | Add assertions to existing tests |
| 2 | `decompose_and_test` | complexity >= threshold AND coverage == 0 | Split function, then add tests |
| 3 | `decompose` | complexity >= threshold AND coverage > 0 | Split function into smaller units |

**Rule evaluation order in code**: Rules 2 and 3 (complexity >= threshold) are checked first, then Rule 1 (Q3), then Rule 0 (default).

---

## Contract Coverage Reasons

When contract coverage is 0% or otherwise diagnostic, a reason field explains why:

| Reason | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `all_effects_ambiguous` | All effects classified as ambiguous; no contractual effects to cover |
| `no_effects_detected` | Function has no detected side effects |
| `no_test_coverage` | Effects detected but no test targets this function |
| `no_assertions_mapped` | Effects exist and tests exist but no assertions mapped to effects |
| *(empty)* | Normal coverage — no special explanation needed |

---

## Assertion Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `equality` | Value equality check (e.g., `assertEqual`, `==`) |
| `error_check` | Error value check (e.g., `if err != nil`) |
| `nil_check` | Nil/null check |
| `diff_check` | Structural diff comparison |
| `custom` | Framework-specific or unrecognized assertion pattern |
